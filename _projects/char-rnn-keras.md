      >, this is an implementation of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network in
      Keras, for learning and sampling from character-level patterns in text.
      This was trained to generate writing in the styles of historical authors,
      like Shakespeare, Hugo, and Caroll.

      A really interesting application was training this network on a corpus of
      folk music, from which it could compose new music fairly well. The website
      linked below has a demo running in your browser.
