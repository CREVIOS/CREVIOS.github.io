      Fast, compiled Datalog for static analysis, with Rust integration.

      _Crepe_ is a library that allows you to write declarative logic
      programs in Rust, with a
      [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)-like syntax.
      It provides a procedural macro that generates efficient, safe code and
      interoperates seamlessly with Rust programs.
    </p>
    <p markdown="1">
      Inspired by the power of [Souffle](https://souffle-lang.github.io/) and
      [Formulog](https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog), this project
      is unique in enabling safe integration of arbitrary functions from the
      host language (Rust) within compiled Horn clauses. It also includes many
      features of modern Datalog implementations: stratified negation,
      semi-naive evaluation, and automatic index generation.
